What are the types of data available to you?
I took a look at the Actors List from the IMDB dataset (ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/actors.list.gz). This dataset includes the actors name and then a list of appearances that they have made in either movies or television. The data includes the actor's name, movie/television show name and the year of the appearance.

For data sets: how many records are in the data set?
Using wc -l, I discovered that there are 13,638,281 lines in the actors.list. Each tv/movie appearance takes up a line, so presumably this number mostly represents appearances rather than actors.

For API: what are the limits on fetching data? 
Given that this list was available for download, the limits for fetching the data via an API did not apply.

Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting
Using 'less' to browse the data,  the first Actor I discovered, who had a larger number of TV/Movie appearances, was 50 Cent. It was interesting to see all of the appearances that 50 Cent has made that I had no clue about.

50 Cent                 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies (2005) (TV)  (archive footage)  [Himself - Place #28]
                        13 (2010)  (as Curtis Jackson)  [Jimmy]  <38>
                        2003 MTV Movie Awards (2003) (TV)  [Himself - Performer]
                        2003 Radio Music Awards (2003) (TV)  [Himself]

What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?
After browsing some of the data, I started to wonder if it would be possible to chart out the average length of an actor's career by looking at the year of the first TV/Movie appearance and the actor's most recent appearance. I think that it might also be interesting to find out the average number of TV/Movie appearances an actor makes in their career. Lastly, it might interesting to identify actors who have had large breaks in between their TV/Movie appearances.
