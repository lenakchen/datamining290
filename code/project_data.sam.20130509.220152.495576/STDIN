The area resembles the old shopping strip-meets-new shopping strip of San Luis Obispo.  What they did -- or so I've been told -- is that they've managed to preserve the old strip, leaving it looking the way it presumably did in the 70s.  Rhino Records is located in the older part.  The Back Abbey in the new part.  Both distinct areas of their aesthetic and consumer pull. \n\nThe Back Abbey specializes in Belgian draft beer.  They carry some German and English beer, as well.\n\nWow, the selection of beer. Let me tell you! A lof of them I have never heard of. I tasted the Augustijn (Belgian) and the Hofbrau Original (German).  Both were good, but I prefer the Hofbrau.They come in different sized glasses, with the Hofbrau coming in a long glass. The Augustijn was $9, and the Hofbrau $6. The Hofbrau came in the larger glass, so the Augustijn must be considered some premium brew for it to be in a smaller glass and come knocking down doors at a mighty $9.  \n\nI liked the overall aesthetics of the place. There is an up-close-and-personal feel to the bar. Along with the standard bar and barstools set-up, there's a long table that goes from one end of the bar to the other. People sit across from each other and, since the tables are not wide, you're not far at all from the person sitting in front of you. Like I wrote earlier, up close and personal is what this bar has going for it.\n\nThey have a food menu, as well. Above their draft selection of beer, they have a chalkboard placed high up with a list of what they serve. For those veggies among us, they even make a veggie burger.\n\nLastly, the patrons all seem to know each other. Maybe it's the small town mentality. But it's not exactly a backwards, hick town. It's very much modern in certain ways, and people just love to talk. Couple that with brew, and there's a lot of talk going on.\n\nI had a discussion with someone at the bar, who bartends at a bar not too far from The Back Abbey, and he told me that the Augustijn is the oldest beer recipe known to man. (Ah, ok. Old is vintage. Vintage is expensive. Thus, Augustijn is expensive.  And two + two = four. I got this down, partna'.)   Again, can we give it up for \"up close and personal\"?\n\nAnd, lastly, the bartenders were very attentive and enjoyed talking about the difference between the brews. The goateed gentlemen was specifically patient in describing which ones were Belgian, German, and English.\n\nThe mantra of this review should be \"up close and personal.\"  This is what this 4-star bar is all about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"}

Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.\n\nAll of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.\n\nMy server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn't charged.\n\nI don't blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few \"vegetarians\" who just don't eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. \n\nSo, it's up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we're not totally sure. And this is probably wise at any place where there is an ethnic and language barrier (On a related note, don't be fooled into thinking you can get vegan pho in Philly. It does not exist. You're eating beef broth or non-pho water broth, but not pho made with vegetable stock.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hnz1_h_D1eHSRtQqHSCZkw"}

I got a plate, and I was very pleased with the amount of meat I got.  However, what's the deal with only one pita?  I ran out of pita before I was halfway done with the lamb.  For something that costs so much less than the meat, why not toss another pita on there?  Pita was fine, very average.\n\nFor sides, I got the fries and the green beans (which come in a tomato sauce).  The green beans were too salty, and the fries not enough.  Fries were nice and crispy, but almost no flavor.  Beans were so-so, tasted like they were probably canned, but not bad.\n\nThis place is a good value, so definitely wins points there - plate was just over $7 with tax, and a good amount of food, plus a beverage.  I'm sure this is mostly because it is one of the newest places in PC, but the line was significantly longer/slower than the other places, which makes it tough on your lunch break, so keep in mind if time is an issue.\n\nOverall, two thumbs up on the meat (+2 stars), and a good value (+1 star), which makes it above average for PC offerings, but that standard is already low, unfortunately.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BKI9lC-Mn2W7TtjEInsaLA"}

I loved the service, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive. \n\nSo if you're looking for something different, a little off the beaten path of traditional Brazilian restaurants and you like  to have cheese with your wine before your meal like I do, then I would check this place out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}

I wouldn't say it was particularly good - it was exactly something I could have whipped up at home. My real gripe is that the guy didn't ask me if I wanted my toast buttered. I expected just some toasted bread that I would put jam on or something. But, out comes two slices of overly buttered toast; it was practically a butter sandwich.\n\nI guess that's my real problem with the place. It's set up like a diner but it doesn't have the diner atmosphere. A diner is supposed to be friendly and chatty but the employees didn't talk when I entered, ordered, or waited. It's also supposed to be bustling but the place, which is pretty small to start with, was practically empty at lunch hour. It was a diner without the appeal of one.

My eventual overall dissatisfaction arose from multiple cases of what started off as relatively minor problems.\n\nIn each case, what I thought of as relatively minor problems, grew into unresolvable beasts, when I had a need to contact CUSTOMER SERVICE (and I use that term very loosely). I don't know that they still do so, but I learned to cringe when they answered the phone with, \"How may I provide you with excellent service?\". It got to the point that my standard opening response was, \"I'll accept decent service\". \n\nWithout going further into details, I haven't had business with them for over 3 years now, that said... they have come back, uninvited, into my life.\n\nMy credit monitoring service recently contacted me with a notice of unusual activity. Investigating, I discovered that a collection company out of Florida had placed an unpaid bill of $33 on my credit report. There were no details but digging deeper, I went to http://annualcreditreport.com/ and found that it was associated with an AT&T claim.\n\nAs much as I dislike AT&T, I ALWAYS pay my bills (assuming I'm aware of them). I'm still investigating, but, this is just another check box confirming to NEVER again consider purchasing ANY service from AT&T.\n\nTheir sales people will say all the right things. Their brochures are shiny and refined. Their commercials are alluring. Their actual services and products are.... okay... but when something goes awry, and sooner or later something will... their customer service is substandard, significantly so, and is the basis for AVOIDING this company at all cost.

And i have to get a cookie to go. It keeps the Esselon yummy-ness alive even when I'm back in the city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0tX2BR7qE-IP5Ne6vLwy3A"}

The staff behind the counter is friendly, nice, and they work quickly. \n\nSeat yourself! (The seating area is large, but with the size of the crowd this place pulls in, I imagine people get anxious about whether or not they'll find a table.)\n\nThe pizza tasted so fresh. and so YUM.

I generally don't expect any authentic asian cuisine in Pasadena but that is how many of the yelp reviews described Matsuri and I can see why.\n\nUpon your arrival, you are greeted by a little drumming.  A little hokey, for sure, but still a little charming.  All the staff are Japanese with cute accents - not blonde Pasadena socialites.  \n\nThe food actually tastes homey and handmade too.  \n\nAppetizers:  JALAPENO BOMBERS - jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and fish roe and tempura fried with kewpie mayo and siracha sauce.   I'm not a fan of cream cheese appetizers so this was good, but not my favorite.  I did like the heat of the jalapenos though.  SHI-SO HOT; tempura fried shisho leaf topped with spicy tuna and a drizzling of eel sauce.  This was GREAT.  I was slightly disappointed that the shiso didn't add much flavor but the crisp worked wonderfully in holding up the tuna, which matched very well with the sweet sauce.  GYOZAS are great - handmade with a light loose veggie filling.  \n\nBoyfriend ordered the HAMBURG steak, three thin patties of ground beef with a pan fried crisp bottom and slathered with a homemade ketchup.  It comes with a side of cabbage slaw, potato salad and a wedge of cantaloupe.  Boyfriend liked the potato salad, which had cucumber slices inside. \n\nI ordered the MATSURI CHIRASHI, which came loaded with julienned daikon, furikaka sprinkled over the rice, and a selection of fishes - 3 tuna, 2 tamago, 1 salmon, a pile of ikura,  clam, eel, mackerel and I forget the rest.  \n\nFriend ordered the SPICY TUNA SALAD, which he enjoyed.  \n\nThe cooked entrees are all very reasonably priced at under $15 .

Wrapro is all three and here's how they pull it off:\n\n1. With the quickness: though they make each order right in front of you, it never seems to take more than a few minutes and I am promptly on my way out the door with my lunch in hand.\n\n2. On the cheap. For the most part, cheap makes a sacrifice of quality to some degree and Wrapro is no exception. The lamb is sometimes chewy and the pita they give with the hummus has been stale on more than one occasion. But for less than $7 and a ton of food, it's still a good deal.\n\n3. Easy - the menu is laid out is a simply manner and it's a few minutes walk from my house. Does not get easier than that@\n\nA few points of concern. I am one of those people who writes, in sharpie, \"Please See ID\" on the back of my cards. The man behind the counter once gave me a lecture about this. Dude, I just want some lunch, not a complete credit counseling sesh. Also, the last time I was in, I was given the wrong order and the woman helping me huffed, puffed and mumbled something, then proceeded to charge me the $1.25 difference in price. When I handed my card over (I rarely carry cash), she rolled her eyes and asked if I had any cash. Not the best customer service.\n\nI continue to grab lunch here on occasion, but I've set my expectations to a certain degree and now I am rarely disappointed by Wrapro.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKirSxY1-ScGEzQjfYSI2A"}

Upon hearing that it was our first visit, he walked us through a sampling of all of their homemade sauces and explained each. Perhaps we were there at a slower time, but it was great to have a nice conversation with the owner. He discussed his cooking methods and preferences for BBQ. He even let us try the black-eyed peas and collard greens - both were good...and both were vegan, which was a nice surprise for anyone perhaps looking for vegan options (they also have BBQ tofu options).\n\nMy wife and I walked out of YinzBurgh with chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, collard greens, mac & cheese, and cole slaw; a decent sampling, to say the least.\n\nOverall, I really can't complain about anything. The pulled pork was excellent, the brisket was good (though maybe slightly dry), and the ribs were good. Note, that this isn't the type of BBQ that comes smothered in sauce, and honestly, you don't need much sauce - if any - to enjoy.\n\nAdd in the fact that all of the sides were good, and it's hard to provide any reasons not to go back next time we're in a BBQ mood!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-i3pCgQi_Y9NiSSWs6G7bw"}
