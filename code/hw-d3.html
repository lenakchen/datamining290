/* Notes on data extraction: 
Step 1: I modified the mrjob python script that I am using for the final project to output the Jaccard similarities between business
pairs based on the similarity of words in their review. The key, value output followed this format: None, Jaccard_Similarity

Step 2: I then took the output from mrjob into Excel and removed the 'key' column so it looked like this:
0.010891871
0.018141338
0.018603628
...

Step 3: Finally, I created a python script to truncate the results to only 200 records and format the results into a comma-separated list which I could copy and paste as 'values' data into my d3.html document. Here's a copy of the python script that I used.
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'rU') as d:
        reader = csv.reader(d)
        data = []
        for row in reader:
                data.append(row[0])
        data_string = ','.join(data[0:200])
        print data_string
		
The output of this step looked like this:
0.010891871,0.018141338,0.018603628,...
